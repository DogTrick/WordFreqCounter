You and Greim must go as quickly

as possible. Fly to Dnitz.

Tell him to do anything

it takes to punish Himmler.

We've decided to

die with you.

Thank you for this proof of loyalty.

But Himmler must die.

He committed treason.

He's no longer privvy

to my plans.

Mein Fhrer?

Do you think I'll sit and wait until

those Jewish swine slaughter me?

This is part of a huge decoy manoeuvre.

I've allowed the enemy...

...to invade the Reich and they

think they've won.

But mark my words: they have

another thing coming.

Dnitz is mobilising in the north.

Kesselring in the south.

We'll surround the enemy

and crush them.

From Prague, three armies will attack

the Russians, simultaneously, from the back.

I didn't know we still had

so many reserve troops.

I made sure you'll soon have

a 1000 of the most modern...

...jets at your disposal.

With those, you can make the

Luftwaffe ready for battle again.

I kneel to your genius, at the

altar of the motherland.

Heil, mein Fhrer.

You also request to leave Berlin?

Mein Fhrer, as you know,

all medical departments...

...that fall under the SS and Himmler,

have left Berlin.

Himmler is a traitor.

He won't escape punishment.

Mein Fhrer, as Reichsarzt SS,

I have no more work here.

Your request to leave Berlin

is unacceptable.

My family...

If the Russians...

I must leave.

You did nothing wrong.

Future generations will thank you

for you medical research.

I take all the responsibility.

We'll talk about it later.

Gruppenfhrer Fegelein cannot

be found. He's not in the bunker.

What, you can't find Fegelein?

Keep searching.

I need to talk to him. Immediately.

If he left just like that,

that's desertion. Treason.

Bring me Fegelein.

Fegelein. Fegelein.

Daddy, why are you wearing

your Sunday uniform?

Ernst, is something wrong?

-No.

Thank you.

Brigitte is hungry too.

Ilse, you should

eat something as well.

Thank you.

-There you go.

Thank you.

What is it?

-Gruppenfhrer, you're under arrest.

What?

-You're suspected of desertion.

Get dressed.

You'll come with us.

Search the room.

Let go of me.

You can't give me orders.

You can't have Hermann

executed, can you?

There's no doubt.

He wanted to flee.

What does it matter?

Everything's over.

Think of my poor sister.

She's pregnant by Hermann.

He collaborated with Himmler.

He's a traitor.

There's no mercy for traitors.

No compassion for them.

He'll be court-martialled

and executed.

What's the point of that?

It is my wish.

You're the Fhrer.

Speak.

The Russians are advancing

more and more.

There are no more reserves.

Supplies from the air are impossible.

There is no ammunition coming

in anymore.

In the north, the Russians are standing

in front of the Weidendammer bridge.

In the east:
Lustgarten.

South:
Potsdammer Platz.

West:
Tiergarten, about 400 metres

away from the chancellery.

How long can you hold out?

-At most, two days.

Including the government area?

-Yes.

As a soldier, I suggest we

flee Berlin. It's surrounded.

The battle of Berlin killed about

That's what young people are for.

What you suggest is insane.

Ridiculous.

Think of the thousands of wounded.

We can't help them.

Mein Fhrer, the orders have been written.

I give you my word...

The Fhrer cannot make a honourless

disappearance from world history.

Even if an advance is successful...

...I'll end up in another

troublesome situation.

I'd have to stay in the open air

or on a farm...

...and wait for the end.

Wenck is advancing with the 12th army.

He can join the 9th...

...and give the Russians

the final blow.

Wenck's an excellent fellow.

Send a telegram to Keitel:

Immediately report to me the following:

You'll see, gentlemen.

I'll be right.

Wenck will come.

Wenck will come.

I want to know if Wenck

can do anything at all.

It's unlikely that Wenck's

small amount of troops...

What's unlikely about the offensive?

-Wenck can't do anything anymore.

Then why don't you tell the Fhrer that?

Has everybody gone mad?

Do you think the Fhrer doesn't know?

He'll never surrender.

And neither will we. I've been

through that once. Never again.

Come along. I have to go.

Stop right there.

Heil Hitler.

Excuse me. I fell asleep.

Did you get some rest, my child?

In shorthand.

My political will.

More than 30 years have passed...

...since I made my contribution

as a volunteer...

...during the first World War.

During those 30 years,

I learnt to think, act and live...

...out of love and loyalty

for my people.

Excuse me. The shooting.

-Please sit down.

Centuries will pass...

...but from the ruins

of our cities and monuments...

...the hatred

of the people...

...who did this to us,

will continue to flare up.

International Judaism and

its allies.

What is it, Herr Minister?

Imagine this.

The Fhrer wants me to leave Berlin.

He ordered it.

I've never ignored an order

from the Fhrer.

But I will ignore this order.

I'll stay with the Fhrer.

Please, Frau Junge...

...I want to dictate my will to you.

I'm typing

the Fhrer's will.

Good.

I understand.

Some other time.

Mein Fhrer, according to the racial law

I'm obliged to ask you:

Mein Fhrer, are you

of Aryan descent?

Can I see your identity card?

You're talking to the Fhrer here.

-Alright then.

And you, Frulein Braun,

are you of Aryan descent?

Then there's nothing

to stop us.

I'm asking you now:
